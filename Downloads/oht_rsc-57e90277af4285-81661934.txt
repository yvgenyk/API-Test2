Only the 1993-94 Golden State Warriors have come close to matching this level of offensive output, and they did so over a meager three-game stretch while playing even worse defense. It's basically impossible to maintain scoring success this extreme for a prolonged stretch, but the Cavs are making the impossible, well, possible. 

James has helped, averaging 25.3 points and 6.8 assists heading into Thursday night's affair, in which he submitted a triple-double with 23 points, 11 boards and 11 assists. Irving chipped in 19.6 points and 4.7 dimes over Cleveland's first nine playoff games. Three players have averaged at least an offensive rebound per contest, led by Tristan Thompson and his 5.0 successful creations of second-chance opportunities during his typical outing. 

And, of course, the whole team has caught fire from the outside.
